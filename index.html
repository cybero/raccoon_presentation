        <h1>Welcome to my presentation on raccoons</h1>
        <p>The clever, busy and beautiful raccoon is a very common sight across much of North America. They can be found
            in woodlands and farmlands, but they have also adapted to a variety of human habitats including suburbs and
            big cities. Raccoons are mostly nocturnal, highly intelligent and will eat just about anything, so making
            their way through an urban environment is not challenging. </p>
        <p> Their main requirement in any habitat is a water
            source. Raccoons are rarely found denning more than a few hundred yards from some constant source of water.
            Streams and ponds are ideal, but in urban and suburban
            situations raccoons will make use of fountains, backyard pools and koi ponds.</p>

        <h1>Raccoons are amazing!</h1>
        <p>The raccoon is a carnivore which enjoys catching lots of very small prey including insects, mice, birds and
            fish. They have been seen fishing with their hands, and will catch toads and turtles and crayfish with their
            front paws as well, coming in quickly with a kill bite lest their quarry escapes their grasp. The raccoon
            does not have opposable thumbs, and in fact, their front paws do not look human, or even primate.</p>
        <p> They are similar in shape to a weasel or ferret paw, but there is no webbing between the front toes
            at all, giving the digits the look of fingers. The "pinkie" finger and "thumb" are offset from the middle
            three digits and can come together across the middle of the palm allowing the raccoon to grasp things and
            manipulate items with reasonable strength and extreme dexterity.</p>

        <p>Raccoons have been know to unscrew jars, undo locks and untie knots. The combination of bright mind and
            dexterous paws is highly effective and the raccoon has a reputation as a master thief and garbage-can
            ransacker. Many a homeowner has spent their spare time in a backyard war with the unstoppable neighborhood
            raccoons, who somehow manage to get into sheds, feed bins, dumpsters and doggie doors defying all manor of
            bungee cords, twist ties, latches and ropes.</p>
        <p>Once considered to be in the bear family, the raccoon is now
            placed in the family Procyonidae which include the coatimundi and the kinkajou, both from South America. The
            raccoon is further separated into its own genus, Procyon, which includes 7 species of raccoon distributed
            across North and Central America, that vary only slightly in size and color.</p>

        <h1>Please Sir, may I have your trash?</h1>
        <p>Although some consider the raccoon simply a common pest, it is actually anything but common. Raccoons have
            several very unusual physical specialties that make them unique in the animal world, including a wildly
            advanced tactile ability that is highlighted by their having whiskers on their toes! These whiskers are
            called vibrissae and extend just beyond the raccoons front claws. Like the whiskers on many animals faces,
            they transmit information when the tips touch an object.</P>

        <p> In fact, the raccoonâ€™s sense of touch, and in particular sensory input from the forepaws takes up more than
            65% of the section of the brain that processes all sensory input. Raccoons are analyzing their world by feel
            and it is its most important and specialized sense. The furless palms of the front paws are protected by a
            thin layer of horny skin - somewhat like a callous - which becomes soft and pliable when wet. This added
            sensitivity to already hyper sensitive hands, may be why raccoons are known to wash their food in water
            before eating it.</p>
